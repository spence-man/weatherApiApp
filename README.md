## Synopsis

This is an educational project that is intended for learning purposes only. I built this web application during an online Web Developer course. Its purpose was to become familiar with API's and include them in a project. This project used a weather API that retrieved a couple different data points from that API and reproduced the results through this portal page. 


## Motivation

This was created to further educate my knowledge of different API's and their application.
